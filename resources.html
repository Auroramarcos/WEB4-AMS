						<figcaption>BADGES</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						I really like this particular Bootstrap badge component. The last row of examples is the one that caught my attention the most, as I think it represents the cleanest and most visually balanced option. I have used similar components in some of my projects, especially when I need to display counters, indicators, or discreet labels without overloading the interface. In those cases, I opted for a style similar to that of the last row: soft colors, proportionate spacing, and no overly aggressive borders, so that the badges integrate elegantly into the overall design.

						<figcaption>CURSOR</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						I find Tailwind's cursor utilities component very interesting because it allows you to quickly and clearly change the appearance of the cursor with classes (e.g., cursor-pointer, cursor-not-allowed, cursor-move, etc.). I particularly value this tool when I want to improve the user experience by making it clearer which elements are interactive or what the cursor status is in specific situations. I have never used this tool, and I think it could be easy to use.

						<figcaption>SWIPE GALLERY</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						In my opinion this tool is very useful because I wanted to do something similar in my personal portfolio: a smooth transition between elements that looked fluid and seamless.
						At the time, I didn't achieve a completely satisfactory result; the animations weren't entirely smooth and there were small flickering glitches.
						That's why this tool is useful to me: it works well, looks clean, and is fluid.
						I will most likely use it as the basis for my next project, adapting it to my style, as it offers just the transition quality I was looking for.

						<figcaption>MORPHING</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						I find this animation very interesting and creative, as it transforms the play icon into pause (and vice versa) with a fluid and elegant effect.
						Although I probably wouldn't use it in my projects with the play/pause symbol specifically, because my designs usually require other types of icons or interactions, I find the animation itself very interesting. I think the approach and technique in this example could serve as inspiration for other interactive elements in my future projects.

						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						This tool is often used, and it's not particularly revolutionary, but I still find it very useful and it's a different way of displaying a carousel of images, for example.

					<p>
						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						I’ve noticed that many blogs use this tool because it helps websites load fast and is easy to host for free on GitHub Pages. However, in my opinion, this feels too technical for me, so I don’t plan to use it for now.

						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						While browsing, I discovered that Hugo offers a wide variety of free, open-source templates designed especially for portfolios. 
						This is very useful to me because I can choose a theme that already has a clean design and customize it without having to start from scratch. 
						I've taken several screenshots of my favorite templates to show various styles, from minimalist single-page portfolios 
						to gallery-style grid designs.

						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						I didn't know about this page, and I found it very interesting and, above all, useful, since it allows you to create responsive websites without writing code, which is a pretty big advantage. I think this could be very useful for my final project, and I will definitely use this tool.

  <h2>Critical Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    Comparing tools has helped me analyze each one more carefully and investigate which ones could help with my final project, and which ones I would consider best not to use.
  </p>

  <h3>Comments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Speed vs. Flexibility</strong></li>
	<p>
		For example, tools such as Hugo are faster to use compared to other tools but less flexible than Tailwind, for example, which allows me to customize more but requires a little more time.
	</p>
    <li><strong>Dependencies vs. Simplicity</strong></li>
	<p>
		One example would be Node.js, which offers many options but requires installing dependencies; HTML5 UP, on the other hand, is simpler because you only need to download templates.
	</p>
    <li><strong>Node.js vs. Standalone</strong></li>
	<p>
		Tailwind depends on Node.js, while Hugo is standalone; so this would help me choose based on the type of project I'm going to do.
	</p>
    <li><strong>Creativity vs. Convention</strong></li>
	<p>
		Bootstrap and templates offer conventional designs, while GSAP allows you to be more creative and you don't have to follow such a specific template as in the other case.
	</p>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tools that best fit my workflow</h3>
  <p>
    I think the tools that would be most suitable would be Bootstrap, Tailwind, and GSAP Swipe.
