					<h3><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="assets/img/img1.png" alt="Bootstrap demo" width="640" height="360" />
						<figcaption>BADGES</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						I really like this particular Bootstrap badge component. The last row of examples is the one that caught my attention the most, as I think it represents the cleanest and most visually balanced option. I have used similar components in some of my projects, especially when I need to display counters, indicators, or discreet labels without overloading the interface. In those cases, I opted for a style similar to that of the last row: soft colors, proportionate spacing, and no overly aggressive borders, so that the badges integrate elegantly into the overall design.

						<figcaption>CURSOR</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						I find Tailwind's cursor utilities component very interesting because it allows you to quickly and clearly change the appearance of the cursor with classes (e.g., cursor-pointer, cursor-not-allowed, cursor-move, etc.). I particularly value this tool when I want to improve the user experience by making it clearer which elements are interactive or what the cursor status is in specific situations. I have never used this tool, and I think it could be easy to use.

						<figcaption>SWIPE GALLERY</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						In my opinion this tool is very useful because I wanted to do something similar in my personal portfolio: a smooth transition between elements that looked fluid and seamless.
At the time, I didn't achieve a completely satisfactory result; the animations weren't entirely smooth and there were small flickering glitches.
That's why this tool is useful to me: it works well, looks clean, and is fluid.
I will most likely use it as the basis for my next project, adapting it to my style, as it offers just the transition quality I was looking for.

						<img src="assets/img/img4.png" alt="GSAP demo" width="640" height="360" />
						<figcaption>MORPHING</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						I find this animation very interesting and creative, as it transforms the play icon into pause (and vice versa) with a fluid and elegant effect.
Although I probably wouldn't use it in my projects with the play/pause symbol specifically, because my designs usually require other types of icons or interactions, I find the animation itself very interesting. I think the approach and technique in this example could serve as inspiration for other interactive elements in my future projects.

						<figcaption>PARALLELISM</figcaption>

						<strong>Notes:</strong>
						This tool is often used, and it's not particularly revolutionary, but I still find it very useful and it's a different way of displaying a carousel of images, for example.
